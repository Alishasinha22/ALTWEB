# ALTWEB
ALTWEB is a responsive web-based directory that curates free alternatives to commonly used paid websites and tools across multiple domains, including education, jobs, productivity, content creation, streaming, and knowledge resources. The project is designed to help students and early professionals discover accessible tools without subscription barriers.

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with all website data managed through a structured JSON file, enabling easy scalability and maintenance. Users can search websites by name, category, or tags, filter results dynamically, and mark preferred tools using a favorites feature.

The interface supports light and dark modes and is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a consistent user experience across screen sizes. All interactions are handled on the client side, focusing on performance, simplicity, and usability.

ALTWEB demonstrates core frontend development concepts such as dynamic DOM manipulation, responsive UI design, data-driven rendering, and clean user interface structuring. The project is deployed on GitHub, making it publicly accessible and suitable for real-world use and further expansion.
